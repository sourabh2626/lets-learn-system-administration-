Package management :
It is a method of installing, updating, removing, and keeping track of software updates from specific repositories (repos) in the Linux system.

In the early days of Linux, programs were only distributed as source code, along with the required man pages, the necessary configuration files, and more. 
Nowadays, most Linux distributors use by default pre-built programs or sets of programs called packages, which are presented to users ready for installation on that distribution. 
However, one of the wonders of Linux is still the possibility to obtain source code of a program to be studied, improved, and compiled.

How package management systems work :
If a certain package requires a certain resource such as a shared library, or another package, it is said to have a dependency. 
All modern package management systems provide some method of dependency resolution to ensure that when a package is installed, all of its dependencies are installed as well.

Linux distros often use different package management tools. Red Hat-based distros use RPM (RPM Package Manager) and YUM/DNF (Yellow Dog Updater, Modified/Dandified YUM).

Yellow Dog Updater, Modified (YUM) :
YUM is the primary package management tool for installing, updating, removing, and managing software packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. 
YUM performs dependency resolution when installing, updating, and removing software packages. 
YUM can manage packages from installed repositories in the system or from .rpm packages. The main configuration file for YUM is at /etc/yum.conf, and all the repos are at /etc/yum.repos.d.

yum -option command

There are many options and commands available to use with YUM. I've listed some commonly-used commands for YUM below:

yum      : install	Installs the specified packages
remove   : Removes the specified packages
search	 : Searches package metadata for keywords
info     : Lists description
update	 : Updates each package to the latest version
repolist : Lists repositories
history	 : Displays what has happened in past transactions

The following are commonly-used options with YUM:

-C	         : Runs from system cache
--security	 : Includes packages that provide a fix for a security issue
-y	         : Answers yes to all questions
--skip-broken: Skips packages causing problems
-v           : Verbose

RPM (RPM Package Manager) :
RPM is a popular package management tool in Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based distros. 
Using RPM, you can install, uninstall, and query individual software packages. Still, it cannot manage dependency resolution like YUM. 
RPM does provide you useful output, including a list of required packages. An RPM package consists of an archive of files and metadata. 
Metadata includes helper scripts, file attributes, and information about packages.

Options for the modes are found on the RPM man pages at man rpm.

Some commonly-used modes are listed below:

-i	Installs a package
-U	Upgrades a package
-e	Erases a package
-V	Verifies a package
-q	Queries a package

Here are some commonly-used general options:

-? | --help	  Prints help
--version    	Prints version number
-v	          Prints verbose output

To install or upgrade an .rpm package using RPM, issue this command:

rpm -i package-file
rpm -U package-file
rpm -ivh package-file

some others useful cmnds are-
$ sudo yum update httpd = To check for and update httpd package.
$ yum list installed = To list all installed packages.
$ yum list installed httpd = To Find out if httpd package installed or not on the system.
$ yum search {package-name} = To search for packages by name.
$ yum info {pkg-1} {pkg-2} = To see detailed information about a package.
$ yum deplist {pkg} = To show dependencies list for a package.
# yum install {package-name-1} {package-name-2} = To install the specified packages.
# yum downgrade {pkg} = To downgrade a package to an earlier version.
# yum reinstall {pkg} = To reinstall a package again.
